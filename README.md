TASK4-
CALCULATOR
It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
It will need a display screen to display the userâ€™s input and give the results.
